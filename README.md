# humidity-controller-arduino
## This system was created for University Assigment<br />
NOT FULLY TRANSLATED, soon it will all be translated to English<br />
<br />
<br />
We used an arduino with a humidity sensor, a local database and a local host.<br />
We wrote code in <br />
1. Arduino programming language, <br />
2. Python (to built a bridge for arduino values and the database),<br />
3. MySQL (for the database) and<br />
4. PHP (to create a web page to visualize the info as a deliverable)<br />
The reason we used those technologies is that we already were familiar with them<br />

### --------------------- Short Description -------------------------<br />
The system detects the soil humidity every hour. <br />
The system sends the humidity values to mySQL database to store it. <br />
Every 24hours the server calculates the average humidity and stores it. <br />
A site (php) was created to show the data from the database.<br />
<br />
