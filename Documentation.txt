DATABASE
	Start XAMPP and turn on Apache and MySQL
	Click Admin on MySQL
	Import the sql file named 127_0_0_1.sql (https://github.com/Tsagania/humidity-controller-arduino/blob/main/127_0_0_1.sql)


ARDUINO SCETCH
	Start the arduino environment and click open file
	You need to have the circuit ready and load the file sketch_mar29a.ino (https://github.com/Tsagania/humidity-controller-arduino/blob/main/sketch_mar29a.ino)
	
	
PYTHON CODE
	If you downloaded python to your computer:
		From Start search for CMD and copy paste one by one the following lines(16 & 17) to install two libraries
	If you use python from an environment like Anaconda 
		Search in the start menu for Anaconda Prompt (or your program's prompt) and copy paste one by one the following lines(16 & 17) to install two libraries
	pip install mysql-connector-python
	pip install pyserial
	
	In line 19 of the myarduino.py (https://github.com/Tsagania/humidity-controller-arduino/blob/main/myarduino.py) there's this code: ser = serial.Serial('NAME PORT', 		9600), the first parameter is your activated arduino PORT. Your arduino system must be turned on. You can find the PORT that the system uses by opening TOOLS (from 		arduino sketch) and look up for COM* (where *= 0 or 1 or 2 or... 9)
	
	Now you can run the python program


PHP CODE
	While database is running (line 2 in this document 'turn on Apache and MySQL')
	Copy the ARDUINO_PHP folder to XAMPP folder 'htdocs' (you can find the folder by clicking the Explorer button)
	Open a browser and search localhost/ARDUINO_PHP/index.php, hit ENTER and VOILA!
	
	
_WILL BE ADDED SOON ASSIGMENT REPORT_
	ASSIGMENT_DESC.decx includes the circuit's description and how to create it
